        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix</li>
            <li>4 pork chops, trimmed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pour butter
                into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together egg, milk, and pepper in a shallow dish. Place
                stuffing mix in a separate shallow dish. Dip pork chops in egg
                mixture, then coat with stuffing mix.
            </li>
            <li>Lay pork chops in the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chops and bake
                until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about
                10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
                center should read at least 145 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy! Oh, and do not forget to take a picture!
